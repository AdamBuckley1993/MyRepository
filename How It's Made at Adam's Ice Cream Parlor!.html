        How it's done at Adam's Ice Cream Parlor!
    </header>
    <p>We make our ice cream from only premium, all-natural ingredients such as the finest, ethically sourced chocolate, cream from milk and eggs to make our very custard-like base sourced only from grass-fed, cage-free hens and the very same with our cows!</p>
